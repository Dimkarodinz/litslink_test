Show the code you would use for a database migration that added a field “permalink” to an existing table called “post”. The migration is to also create a permalink for every existing Post record based on the “title” field. You can use any method you want to convert title to become permalink, the only requirements being permalink must be based on title, must be constructed of only URL valid characters, and must be unique (even if another Post has the same title and converts to the same permalink).
